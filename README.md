VIBE CODED with GPT5 - use at your own risk 

I have tested the modeling by measuring inputs and FIR filter coefficient file - and from my testing it seems to work 100%. 

Features: 
Measurement Import – Load REW exports, auto-parse frequency, magnitude, and phase.
Graphing – Dual magnitude/phase plots with mouse cursor for frequency and customizable ranges
Filters – Model Butterworth and Linkwitz-Riley crossovers.
FIR Design – Linear-phase EQ and Phase EQ with band controls, live preview, and CSV export.
